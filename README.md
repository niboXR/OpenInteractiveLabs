This is the code repository for my gave dev website.

Here is a breakdown of what each folder contains:

| rootfolder | purpose                                             |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| root       | contains code used to render webpages and documents |
| /assets    | contains raw text input files and css files         |
| /docs      | website docs                                        |
| /templates | Templates and cheat sheets                          |

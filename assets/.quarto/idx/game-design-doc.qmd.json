Dungeons and encampments can be taken down for experience and looted for treasure. Mastering a trade will prove valuable in the ultimate quest to defeat the world boss and restore the world's peace.\n\n## Character\n\nCharacters are all humanoids that exist in the world, playable and non-playable. The following stats apply to both.\n\n### Character stats\n\n#### Physical stats\n\nA character has three physical stats:\n\n-   **Vitality** - determines how much damage a character can take. A character's base vitality stat is **100** life points.\n\n-   **Strength** - determines how much damage a character can deal. A character's base strength stat is **10** damage. This means that a fully effective blow will deal **10** points in damage to another character's vitality or an item's durability.\n\n-   **Speed** - determines how quickly a character can move. A character's base walking speed is **INSERT WLK_SPD** and base running speed is **INSERT RUN_SPD**.\n\nThese base values are adjusted slightly based on the character build [^1]. See @tbl-1 for a generalized overview of this system based on character BMI [^2]. Physical stats can be further modified via items and consumables.\n\n[^1]: This design is inspired by Bonelab's avatar system and intended to incentivize thoughtful and diverse character creation.\n\n[^2]: Body Mass Index is calculated from a person's height and weight. While this measure is considered imperfect for real-world applications, it provides a single measure from which base stats can be derived.\n\n+-----------+----------+----------+-------+\n| Character | Vitality | Strength | Speed |\n|           |          |          |       |\n| BMI       |          |          |       |\n+===========+==========+==========+=======+\n| Low       | ➖       | 🔻       | 🔺    |\n+-----------+----------+----------+-------+\n| Med       | ➖       | ➖       | ➖    |\n+-----------+----------+----------+-------+\n| High      | 🔺       | 🔺       | 🔻🔻  |\n+-----------+----------+----------+-------+\n\n: Impact of BMI on character physical stats\\\n🔺stat boost ➖no change 🔻stat penalty {#tbl-1}\n\n#### Standing\n\nA character's standing indicates their threat and morality to others. The two standing stats are:\n\n-   **Level** - an evolving measure of a character's accomplishments. It is derived from enemy encounter outcomes. A character's default and minimum level is **1**. The maximum level is **100**.\n\n-   **Karma** - an evolving measure of a character's deeds. It is derived from your actions. The quests you take on, the enemies you kill, and even your environmental impact will dictate your place in this world. The default karma is **NEUTRAL**. Creating a world with karmic justice requires deep considerations for both the penalties and consequences. See @sec-justice on Karmic Justice for more.\n\n### Character creation\n\n### Character controller\n\n## Environment\n\nA procedural system for the creation of unique and infinitely difficult worlds[^3]. The globe is fully navigable with diverse landscapes, wildlife, and beasts.\n\n[^3]: A procedural system combines parameters for switching between categorical values and random sampling for continuous values. Note that available parameters and probability curves will likely be impacted by other values.\n\n### Resources\n\nAll resources can be gathered the environment. The resource types are:\n\n-   **resources** - various types and qualities of wood, ore, and fibers\n\n-   **ingredients** - various types and qualities of meat, fish, vegetation, and herbs\n\nResources can be gathered and crafted into items by characters engaging in various professions.\n\n### Items\n\nItems can be discovered throughout the world or crafted from resources gathered from the environment. The item types are:\n\n-   **wearables** are crafted from resources by outfitters\n\n-   **consumables** are crafted from ingredients by cooks and from resources by alchemists\n\n-   **tools** are crafted from resources by toolmakers\n\nItems have varying **durability** which can be restored by crafting professionals. Items can also be broken down for partial resources. Items can be carried between worlds and parallel world items are sometimes considered mystic[^4]. Item rarity is based on the reference world's items. See @tbl-2 below for rarity calculations.\n\n[^4]: A parallel world is one whose environment produces any number of distinct resources and ingredients not available in the reference world. An item is considered mystic if it is located in a world without access to the resources it is crafted.\n\n| Rarity    | Color  | Threshold                                      |\n|-----------|--------|------------------------------------------------|\n| Common    | White  | The item makes up no more than 25% of its kind |\n| Uncommon  | Green  | The item makes up less than 25% of its kind    |\n| Rare      | Blue   | The item makes up less than 5% of its kind     |\n| Legendary | Purple | The item makes up less than 1% of its kind     |\n| Unique    | Gold   | The only item of its kind in the world         |\n\n: Rarities\\\nsee @sec-itemkinds on the kinds of items {#tbl-2}\n\n## Economy\n\n### Professions {#sec-professions}\n\nThere are various professions in resources gathering and crafting.\n\n#### Gathering professions\n\nThe following professions are dedicated to the gathering of natural resources and ingredients from the environment:\n\n-   Hunter\n\n-   Fisher\n\n-   Forager\n\n-   Miner\n\n-   Logger\n\n#### Crafting professions\n\nThe following professions are dedicated to crafting items from resources gathered from the environment:\n\n-   Outfitter\n\n-   Toolmaker\n\n-   Cook\n\n-   Barkeep\n\n-   Alchemist\n\n### Trade\n\nResources and items can be traded between characters on the open market or privately. Historical sale prices are public record at the server level.\n\nOne currency, forever.\n\n# Addendum\n\n## Karmic Justice {#sec-justice}\n\nA character's karma can range from **DARK** to **HERO**. Characters can also have **GOOD**, **BAD**, and **NEUTRAL** karma. A character's karma can be positively impacted through the completion of hero quests. More importantly, karma penalties are levied for various misdeeds and the consequences bad karma can be steep.\n\n### Karmic penalties\n\n-   Character killing and looting\n-   Dark quests\n-   Resource overconsumption and waste\n\n### Karmic consequences\n\n-   Loss of safe zone and housing\n-   Beast deformation?\n-   Increased drop rates\n-   Bounties\n\n## The types and kinds of items {#sec-itemkinds}\n\nThis flowchart describes the types and kinds of items and provides some examples of items that may or not be present in the final game.\n\n```{mermaid}\nflowchart LR\nITEMS[(ITEMS)] --> Wearable\nITEMS --> | The types of items | Consumable\nITEMS --> Tool\n\nKindsOfWearables[\"`headwear\n    topwear\n    legwear\n    footwear`\"]\nWearable --> KindsOfWearables\n\nKindsOfConsumables[\"`food\n  drink\n  elixer\n`\"]\nConsumable --> |The kinds of items| KindsOfConsumables\n\nKindsOfTools[\"`sword\n  shield\n  fishing pole\n  pickaxe\n  axe`\"]\nTool --> KindsOfTools\n\nExampleWearables[\"`\n  brass helmet\n  dark tunic\n  leather pants\n  leather boots\n`\"]\n  \nKindsOfWearables --> ExampleWearables\n\nExampleConsumables[\"`\n  beef stew\n  elixer of life\n`\"]\n\nKindsOfConsumables --> |some examples of items|ExampleConsumables\n\nExampleTools[\"`\n  long sword\n  wooden shield\n  bamboo fishing pole\n  iron pickaxe\n  stone axe\n`\"]\n\nKindsOfTools --> ExampleTools\n\n\n```\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n```{r, setup}\n#| include: false\n```\n\n# Overview\n\n## Game description\n\n**`{r} params$GameTitle`** is a stylized open-globe action-adventure fantasy game with support for up to 64 simultaneous players and built from the ground up for physical immersion.\n\nThe world of `{r} params$GameTitle` falls increasingly to darkness.
